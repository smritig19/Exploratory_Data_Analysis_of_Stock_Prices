# Exploratory_Data_Analysis_of_Stock_Prices
For this project I have processes, visualized and analyzed various bank stock prices and examined their progression throughout the [Global Financial Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%9308)  to early 2016 using python libraries such as pandas, seaborn, plotly and matplotlib. 

**NOTE:** Github doesnâ€™t render iframes at the moment. Plotly Charts present in the code file donot show up in github. Click on [Exploratory Data Analysis of Stock Prices]() to view the plotly interactive graphs using nbviewer.
